# Voici

üöß **WARNING: Voici is still a work in progress and should not be used for production workloads.** üöß

Voici is a tool for generating static dashboards from Jupyter Notebooks. Unlike [Voil√†](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila), which renders interactive dashboards using server-side execution, Voici uses [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) (Wasm) kernels to render notebooks in the browser, making the resulting dashboard entirely self-contained and distributable.

This is made possible thanks to the amazing work done in the [JupyterLite project](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite).

## Features üöÄ

- Generates self-contained HTML files with embedded Wasm kernels.
- Works offline, without requiring a server to run the dashboard.
- Supports custom templates for styling dashboards, powered by Jinja2.
- Supports all programming languages that have JupyterLite kernels available. _e.g._ the default JavaScript and Python kernels JupyterLite provides, [python with xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-kernel), [lua](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-lua-kernel), [nelson](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-nelson-kernel)

## Getting Started üèÅ

To use Voici, you'll need to install it first:

```bash
pip install voici
```

Then, you can generate static dashboards from a directory of Notebooks like this:

```bash
voici build --contents notebooks/
```

Once your dashboards built, you can simply serve them with a simple static server, _e.g._:

```bash
cd _output
python -m http.server
```

The `voici` command line interface is the same as the `jupyter lite` one. The only difference is that the `voici build` command will only generate Voici dashboards, excluding the full JupyterLab interface from the output. Running `voici build .` is equivalent to running `jupyter lite build . --apps voici`
You can generate the classic `jupyter lite` output alongside your dashboards by specifying the additional apps you want:

```bash
voici build --apps lab --apps retro
```

In order to get some help on how to use the `voici` command, you can run:

```bash
voici --help
```

We'd also suggest looking into the [JupyterLite documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/index.html) for more insights on how to configure your `voici` deployment.

### Build the demo site yourself

Before you can build the demo site from this repository, you will need to install [jupyterlite-xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-kernel):

```bash
pip install jupyterlite-xeus-python
```

You will also need either [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or conda installed in order to build the emscripten environment.

The [demo directory](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici/tree/main/demo) contains:

- `notebooks/`: The directory of Notebooks that will be served by Voici
- `environment.yml`: The file specifying the Emscripten environment that will be used for rendering the dashboards, this must contain all your Notebook dependencies
- `jupyter-lite.json`: The JupyterLite config file, this config will disable the default Python kernel JupyterLite provides, allowing to use xeus-python instead.

Run the following command to build the demo site:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici
cd voici/demo

voici build --contents notebooks
```

Then serve it!

```bash
cd _output
python -m http.server
```

### Make your own Github pages deployment

Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici-demo#-how-to-make-your-own-deployment) for making your own Github pages deployment.

## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

Because Voici uses Wasm kernels to execute notebooks, there are some limitations to the types of notebooks that can be rendered: Some notebook features may not work correctly or may have limited functionality when rendered in Voici.
