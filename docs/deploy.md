# Deploying Voici

## GitHub Pages

You can easily deploy Voici to GitHub Pages using the [voici-demo](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici-demo) template repository.

The template repository contains a GitHub Action that builds the Voici application and deploys it to GitHub Pages. It also contains an `environment.yml` file where you can specify the packages you need. You can also add Notebooks to the `content` folder.
